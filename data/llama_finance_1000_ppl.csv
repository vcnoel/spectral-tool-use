To modify the PHP code to include an attachment with the email, you'll need to use the `mail()` function's additional parameters to specify the attachment. However, since the `mail()` function in PHP does not natively support attachments, we'll use the `mail()` function in combination with the `Content-Transfer-Encoding` header to encode the attachment.

Here's the modified PHP code:

$subject = ""Request for Access to Confidential Documents"";
$message = ""<html>"";
$message.= ""Dear Sir/Madam,<br><br>"";

1,"**Callback in JavaScript**
==========================

A callback in JavaScript is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed at a later time. This allows for asynchronous programming, where the execution of a function is delayed until a certain condition is met or an event occurs.

**Why Callbacks?**
-----------------

Callbacks are useful when you need to perform an action after an operation has completed, such as:

*   When making an asynchronous request to a server
*   When handling user input or events
*   When working with timers or intervals

**Example: Simple Callback**

A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. It is used when the order of selection matters. The formula for permutation is:

nPr = n! / (n - r)!

- n is the total number of items in the set.
- r is the number of items being selected.
-! denotes the factorial function (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1",505,1.4261527994625967,-0.35498046875,-10.84375
