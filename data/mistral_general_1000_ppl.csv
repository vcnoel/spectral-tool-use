The gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters gives us the direction of the steepest descent, and the magnitude of the gradient tells us how steep the slope is.

1,"Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models, including logistic regression. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data. Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function of the model, which encourages the model to use fewer features or coefficients, and to generalize better to new data.

There are two main types of regularization: L1 and L2 regularization. L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty term equal to the absolute value of",605,1.3189757240479507,-0.27685546875,-11.1640625
