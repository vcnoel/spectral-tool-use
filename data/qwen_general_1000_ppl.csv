Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm:

1. The garbage collector scans all objects in memory and marks them as eligible for garbage collection.
2. It then creates new objects by calling copy constructor or move constructor.
3. If an object is not marked as eligible for garbage collection, it is allocated memory from the heap.
4. After marking an object as eligible for garbage collection, the garbage collector calls delete() on it to release the memory.
Copying Algorithm:
